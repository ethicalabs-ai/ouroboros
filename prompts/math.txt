Provide a step-by-step proof that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n². Then, critique your proof and refine it for clarity and rigor.
Find the derivative of f(x) = x^x. Then, analyze potential calculation mistakes and refine the approach.
Consider the Fibonacci sequence. Derive a formula for the sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers. Then, generalize this reasoning to a different recurrence relation of your choice.
Prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers. Then, refine the explanation to make it more accessible to someone unfamiliar with number theory.
Compute the limit: lim (x → 0) (sin x - x) / x³. After your first attempt, identify possible missteps and refine your approach.
